## Overview

The Card component visually groups related information. The component can be built with custom content
or with the Building Block components to provide consistency.

## Props

<ArgTypes />

## Basic usage

Import the Card component, and nest child components and content.

```js
import { Card } from "ubiq-ui"

<Card>
  <div>
    <h4>Custom content</h4>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. </p>
  </div>
</Card>
```

### Clickable card

Passing the `isClickable` prop, will add `:hover` and `:active` styles to
the card component, and will call the function that is passed to the `onClick` prop.

<Canvas of={CardStories.IsClickable} />

### Disabled

To disable user interaction with a clickable Card, passing the `disabled` prop. This
adds an opacity to the component as a visual indicator to the user that interactions 
are disabled.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Disabled} />

## Building blocks

Adding content with consistent padding can be done easily by using the Building block components.

```js
import { Card, CardImage, CardContent, CardActions, Button } from "ubiq-ui"

<Card>
  <CardImage src={cardImage.png} alt={imageAltText} />
  <CardContent>
    <h4>Custom content</h4>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. </p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardActions>
    <Button>Learn more</Button>
  </CardActions>
</Card>
```

### CardImage

Include an image for added context.

### CardContent

<Canvas of={CardContentStories.Default} />

### CardActions

Container for calls to action.
