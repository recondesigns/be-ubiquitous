## Overview

[Github](https://github.com/recondesigns/brutalism-ui/tree/main/src/components/Card/CardImage.tsx)

Adding content with consistent padding can be done easily by using the Building block components.

## Basic usage

Import the CardImage component and apply the required `src` and `alt` props, then place in the UI.

```js
import { CardImage } from "ubiq-ui"
```

<Canvas of={CardImageStories.Default} sourceState="shown" />
