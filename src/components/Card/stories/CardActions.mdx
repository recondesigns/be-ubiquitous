An open Modal will cover the UI with a transparent scrim layer, containing the Modal
dialog with content and actions for the user.

## Basic usage

Import the component, and place it in the UI.

```js
import { CardActions } from "ubiq-ui"
```

### Close with Esc key

By passing the `closeOnEsc` prop, users can close the Modal by pressing the Escape key on their keyboard.
