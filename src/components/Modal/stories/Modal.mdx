An open Modal will cover the UI with a transparent scrim layer, containing the Modal
dialog with content and actions for the user.

## Props

<ArgTypes />

## Basic usage

Import the component, and place it in the UI.

```js
import { Modal } from "ubiq-ui"
```

### Close with Esc key

By passing the `closeOnEsc` prop, users can close the Modal by pressing the Escape key on their keyboard.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.CloseOnEsc} />

### Close with outside click

By passing the `closeOutsideClick` prop, users can close the Modal clicking anywhere outside of the Modal dialog.

<Canvas of={ModalStories.CloseOnOutsideClick} />

## Building blocks

Adding content with consistent padding can be done easily by using the Building block components.

```js
import { Modal, ModalHeader, ModalContent, ModalFooter } from "ubiq-ui"

<Modal>
  <ModalHeader title="Modal title" onClose={closefunc} />
  <ModalContent>...modal content</ModalContent>
  <ModalFooter actions={footerActionsObj} />
</Modal>
```

### ModalHeader

The ModalHeader includes a required title and an optional close button. Using the building blocks
is recommended for consistency, but not required.

### ModalContent

The ModalContent component serves a pre-styled box to contain the Modal
content.

<Canvas of={ModalContentStories.Default} />

### ModalFooter

The ModalFooter component provides a pre-styled container with one, or two buttons.
